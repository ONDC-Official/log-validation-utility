          Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
          high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the intended
          transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the transaction
          context based on the consumer's location and action on their UI. But
          sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP also sets the
          transaction context but it is usually the same as the context of a
          previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction between the BAP and
          the BPP. The context object contains four types of fields.
          <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using fields
          like `domain`, `country`, and `region`.</li><li>Addressing details
          like the sending and receiving platform's ID and API
          URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol version
          that implemented by the sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like
          the method being called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id
          that represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
          pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending times, a
          ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to encrypt
          information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in
          every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S implementations,
          it is not necessary to send the context during the synchronous
          response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the context must be sent
          during all interactions,
